0. Dependencies
Django 1.0.1+
Apache 2.0+ with mod_wsgi
MySQL5 or postgreSQL database

1. Installation
We initially set this up using an ubuntu server, so that would probably be the
easiest way to install the dependencies.  I'm going to assume that you've
already taken care of that.

1.1. Server setup
To get apache to serve the application, you need to use mod_wsgi to point to
the application directory.

Reference: http://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/wiki/IntegrationWithDjango

An example apache configuration would be:

 Alias /media/ /usr/local/django/mysite/media/

 <Directory /usr/local/django/mysite/media>
 Order deny,allow
 Allow from all
 </Directory>

 WSGIScriptAlias / /usr/local/django/mysite/apache/django.wsgi

 <Directory /usr/local/django/mysite/apache>
 Order deny,allow
 Allow from all
 </Directory>

This should be added to the apache.conf or to a similar location.

A mod_wsgi file named django.wsgi should be added to the root directory of the
application.

It should probably look like:
 import os, sys
 sys.path.append('/usr/local/django')
 os.environ['DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE'] = 'mysite.settings'

 import django.core.handlers.wsgi

 application = django.core.handlers.wsgi.WSGIHandler()

1.2. Database setup
In the solar/settings.py file, you want to point it at a database that is set
up for it.  Then, run
% python solar/manage.py syncdb
to create the databases.

Then, load the databases with the database dump solar_db.sql .
